# Canada Status Guide

A simple web app to help people in Canada understand their options when their **work permit** or **study permit** is expiring, so they can maintain legal status and avoid confusion.

## What’s in the app

- **Status checker** – Enter your permit expiry date to see:
  - How many days you have left
  - Whether you should extend, restore status, or seek advice
  - Clear next steps for your situation

- **Options explained**
  - Apply **before** expiry (best): keep status and usually keep working/studying
  - **Restore status** if already expired (within 90 days): must stop working until approved
  - If **more than 90 days** expired: leave Canada and get legal advice

- **Important details**
  - Maintained status rules (same employer/job for work permits)
  - What you can’t do while on maintained status (e.g. renew driver’s licence, SIN)
  - Processing times (e.g. ~120 days for work permit extensions)
  - Why switching to visitor is usually not a good idea if you want to keep working/studying
  - LMIA and employer-specific work permits

- **Study permit extension** – When and how to extend a study permit

- **Checklist** – Step-by-step what to do

- **Official links** – IRCC pages for extending work/study permits, restoring status, and forms
